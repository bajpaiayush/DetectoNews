**#DetectoNews: A Smart System for Automatic Fake News Detection **

**19/09/25** -- Trained our first ever model, a basic one but we had to start somewhere. below is the accuracy chart:

**20/09/25** -- OK, so everything was going fine, but while testing I noticed the model often flagged *well-written fake news as real*, and *odd-sounding but true news as fake*.  
After some research, I realized this might be due to the dataset we were using (*ISOT Dataset*). Since ISOT true news mostly comes from Reuters (formal, factual style) and fake news comes from clickbait sources (sensational, emotional style), the model was learning **writing style instead of truthfulness**.  
To tackle this, we decided to *expand the horizon* of our dataset. Today we picked **two more datasets** along with ISOT, cleaned and preprocessed them, and created one large **final_merged_dataset**.  
The merged dataset now has **~50k true articles and ~50k fake articles** (~110k total), giving us a much broader and balanced foundation for training.  

**22/09/2025** -- Trained model based on Naive Bayes and SVM classifier, using the new integrated merged dataset. There integration with the UI is still left.
